# Phosphorus resin method

Type used: anion exchange membranes (551642S, BDH-Prolabo, VWR International).

## New resin strips:

The resin comes packaged as sheets, so they will need to be cut into strips of 0.9 x 6.2 cm (Tiessen & Moir, 2008).

Note that these are supplied with Cl<sup>-</sup> as the counterion. Therefore, 3 days before use, load the resin strips with bicarbonate using 6 batches of 0.5M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 8.5).  As Cl<sup>-</sup> is a stronger counterion than bicarbonate, not charging properly will give high initial values.

## Used resin strips: 

•	After P extraction, use 6 batches of 0.5 M HCl to remove any residual P over 3 days. 

•	Regenerate the strips over 3 days using 6 batches of 0.5M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 8.5). 

_Be mindful that recharging resin strips takes 6 days (minimum)._

## Resin methodology:
1.	Weigh 2.0 g of dry soil into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
2.	Add 2 charged resin strips and 30 mL of MilliQ. 
3.	Shake the system overnight (16 hours).    
4.	Rinse soil off the resin strips with water before putting them into a new centrifuge tube. 
5.	Elute the resin strips in 20 mL of 0.5 HCl overnight. Measure phosphate and, if necessary, total P (see total P in aqueous matrix methodology). 

### Recipes:
•	0.5M HCl: dilute 44.25 mL conc. HCl in MilliQ, before making up to 1 L.  
•	0.5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 8.5): dissolve 42 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.5 g NaOH in 1 L MilliQ.
