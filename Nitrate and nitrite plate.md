# Vanadium Chloride NO<sub>3</sub> (+NO<sub>2</sub>) plate method

## Preface: 
Adding Vanadium (III) in an acidic solution to a sample causes the reduction of NO<sub>3</sub> to NO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in a colour change. 
If substantial nitrite is expected in the sample, perform the assay described below without the vanadium chloride (Kivlin, 2018). Both a high concentration (> 1ppm) and low concentration (<1 ppm) is provided. 
This plate method has a long incubation time, with a minimum time of 5 hours.

_Note: Because of the Vanadium, a risk assessment is required before conducting the plate method. Talk to Jannie for more information._

###	Low concentration range methodology

#### Calibration range: 0.05 ppm – 1ppm

1.	Add 100 µL of sample/standard into the well

2.	Using a multi-channel pipette, add 100 µL of the working reagent to the well. Mix by pumping the solution through the pipette tips.

3.	Allow the plate to sit for a minimum of 5 hours. Overnight incubations (16-18 hours) are also acceptable.

4.	Once incubated, read on the plate reader at 540 nm. 

###	High concentration range methodology
#### Calibration range: 0.5 ppm – 10 ppm

1.	Add 10 µL of sample/standard into the well

2.	Using a multi-channel pipette, add 160 µL of the working reagent to the well. Mix by pumping the solution through the pipette tips.

3.	Allow the plate to sit for a minimum of 5 hours. Overnight incubations (16-18 hours) are also acceptable.

4.	Once incubated, read on the plate reader at 540 nm. 

_Note: If the incubation period is too long or the samples are too concentrated, the pink colour will fade. Simply dilute and/or rerun the samples._

### Waste information

<b>DO NOT DUMP THE WORKING REAGENT DOWN THE SINK.</b> Vanadium is incredibly toxic. Either add the spent reagents to an existing waste bottle or make a new waste label. 

## Reagents and stock recipes for the NO<sub>3</sub> (+NO<sub>2</sub>) plate method

#### Preface: 
Proper care must be taken when working with VCl<sub>3</sub>. It oxidizes rapidly, so minimizing exposure to air ensures that the standard lasts longer. 

## Reagent solutions:

• 1 M HCl: Add 250 ml MilliQ to a 0.5 L volumetric flask, Add 44.25 ml HCl, and bring up to 0.5 L with MilliQ

• 2% sulfanilamide solution: Add 0.2 g sulfanilamide to 10 ml of 1 M HCl.  

_Note: This solution can be stored frozen for up to 3 months if purged with N<sub>2</sub> or He._ 

• 0.2% N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) solution: Add 0.02 g NED to 10 ml MilliQ 

_Note: This solution can be stored frozen for up to 3 months if purged with N<sub>2</sub> or He._ 

• Saturated vanadium chloride solution: Weigh 0.35 g vanadium (III) chloride in a fume hood to 25 ml 1 M HCl in a 50 mL volumetric flask.	Stir gently for 10 minutes. Bring up to 50 mL using 1 M HCl. Filter the solution (0.45 µm) if any particulates remain.

_Note: This solution is stable for a week if stored in dark at 4°C._

### Working reagent - Vanadium “Cocktail”: 

Mix the following solution amount with 400 mL MilliQ in a 1 L media bottle:

•	50 ml saturated vanadium chloride solution 

•	3.3 ml 2 % sulfanilamide solution 

•	3.3 ml 0.2 % NED solution 

_Note: This solution is stable for 3 months in the freezer._

#### Low concentration range curve

##### 1 ppm NO<sub>3</sub> (10 mL)

Mix 100 µL of the 100 ppm NO<sub>3</sub> stock with 9.9 mL MilliQ.

Combine the following ratios in a microcentrifuge tube:

Calibration Curve [C]	| µl of 1 ppm stock |	µl of Extraction Matrix
--------------------- | ----------------- | -----------------------
0.0 ppm 	0	| 1000
0.05 ppm |	50 |	950
0.1 ppm	| 100 | 900
0.2 ppm	| 200 |	800
0.5 ppm	| 500 | 500
1.0 ppm	| 1000 | 0


#### High concentration range curve

##### 10 ppm NO<sub>3</sub> (10 mL)
Mix 1 mL of the 100 ppm NO<sub>3</sub> stock with 9.0 mL MilliQ

Combine the following ratios in a microcentrifuge tube:

Calibration curve [C] | µl of 10ppm stock |	µl of Extraction Matrix
--------------------- | ----------------- | -----------------------
0.0 ppm	| 0	| 1000
0.5 ppm	| 50 | 950
1.0 ppm	| 100 | 900
2.0 ppm	| 200	| 800
5.0 ppm	| 500	| 500
7.5 ppm	| 750	| 250
10.0 ppm	| 1000 | 0

#### Quantification

The plate reader provides absorbance values. 

1.	Check the linearity (y=mx + b) of the calibration curve by comparing the known amount of stock (X) to the absorbance (Y). 

•	Solve for X via X = (Y- b) /m

•	For a calibration curve to pass, it needs at least 3 points at R2 = >0.99. 

2.	Correct sample concentration by subtracting average blank values.

3.	Measure the concentration of each sample. 

•	If the value is above or below the lowest point of the calibration curve (i.e., above 1 ppm or 0.05 ppm), either dilute or denote that concentration is >0.05 ppm. 

4.	Check the quality controls (duplicates and spikes, if applicable). Acceptable range is 15-20%, depending on your project. A passing plate requires that quality control accuracy is above 66%.

5.	Convert ppm to µg/g of soil (mg/kg) by multiplying by the volume (mL) of extractant used, followed by dividing the value by g of dry soil used. 

#### When does a plate fail?

Plates fail when one or more of the following conditions occur:

1.	The calibration curve is below R2 = >0.99 with any combination of a minimum of 3 standards.

2.	The accuracy of all quality controls falls below 66%. 

3.	The blanks are erratic.

4.	The plate was dropped, or samples were splashed into neighbouring wells. 

5.	The plate incubated for too long before measurement. 

<b>If the plate does fail, it must be rerun (☹).</b>

### Cleaning up:

Plates should be cleaned up immediately after measurement. Prolonged exposure of the plate to the colorimetric solution tends to dye the plastic, rendering it unusable in the future.

1.	Start by using a squeeze bottle to gently run water into each well. Guide the stream into the corresponding waste container. 

2.	Once all the noticeably coloured liquid has been removed from the plate, place the plate into the acid bath. Leave it overnight.

3.	If the plate appears stained, throw it out. If the plate appears clean, rinse with MilliQ in preparation for a future plate experiment.
