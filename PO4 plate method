# Malachite green – PO4 colorimetry methodology

## Principle
This protocol describes the preparation of the two reagents needed for colorimetric determination of phosphate concentrations in solutions using malachite green (Ohno & Zibilske 1991).

## Reagents 

###Reagent 1:

1.	Use a 1000 ml volumetric flask: pour 165ml of concentrated sulphuric acid into 500ml of deionised water. Do this in an ice bath under the fume hood with continuous stirring.
2.	Use a 250- or 500-ml Schott bottle: dissolve 17.55 g of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24 4H2O, MW= 1235.86 CAS #] in 250ml deionised water. Stir it for 2 hours.
3.	When both solutions are cool, pour ammonium molybdate solution into sulphuric acid solution.
4.	Mix with magnetic stirrer and make up to 1000ml with deionised water.
5.	Store solution in fridge (4C) in 1L Schott bottle covered in aluminium foil.

###Reagent 2:

1.	Heat 1000 ml of deionised water in a 2L Erlenmeyer to about 80C (set the heating plate at a higher temperature and use a thermometer to measure the temperature in the solution).
2.	Turn heat down and add 3.5 g of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA 72000; CAS #). The PVA tends to stick to the walls of the container, to avoid this put the solid in the middle of the container. 
3.	Mix with magnetic stirrer for about 1 to 1.5 hours to ensure that PVA dissolves.
4.	Turn off heat and add 0.35 g of malachite green (malachite green is toxic, work under the fume hood also during weighing and wear gloves).
5.	Stir for about 15 mins and transfer into 1L Schott bottle.
6.	Store solution at room temperature in a dark/brown bottle.


###Calibration range: 0.05 ppm – 1ppm

1.	Add 200 µL of sample/standard into the well
    -	If above the calibration curve range, dilute accordingly.
2.	Using a multi-channel pipette, add 40 µL of reagent 1 to the well. 
    -	If measuring a bicarbonate matrix sample, allow it to effervesce for 30 minutes. Bubbles will negatively influence colorimetry measurement.
3.	Using a multi-channel pipette, add 40 µL of reagent 2 to the well. Mix well.
4.	Allow the plate to sit for a minimum of 45 minutes. 
    -	The solution is incredibly stable and can sit for longer if needed. 
5.	Once incubated, read on the plate reader at 650 nm. 

**NOTE:** if the concentration of the sample is too high, it will turn a very dark green. It’s often easy to determine which samples are above the calibration curve range before incubation is complete. Simply take a note, dilute the sample (1/2 to 1/10 is recommended) and run it again.

##Stock solution and calibration curve

###1000 ppm PO4 stock phosphate solution: 
Add 4.3937 g oven dried KH2PO4 to 1000 ml MilliQ

###1 ppm PO4 (10 mL)
Mix 10 µL of the 1000 ppm PO4 stock with 9.99 mL MilliQ.

Put the following volumes directly into the well:
|Calibration Curve [C]	| µl of 1 ppm stock |	µl of Extraction Matrix |
| --------------------- |-------------------|-------------------------|
|         0.0 ppm     	|         0        	|            200          |
|        0.05 ppm     	|        10         |            190          |
|         0.1 ppm     	|        20	        |            180          |
|         0.2 ppm     	|        40	        |            160          |
|         0.5 ppm	      |       100         |            100          |
|         1.0 ppm	      |       200         |            	0           |


##Quantification

The plate reader provides absorbance values. 
1.	Check the linearity (y=mx + b) of the calibration curve by comparing the known amount of stock (X) to the absorbance (Y). 
    - Solve for X via X = (Y- b) /m
    - For a calibration curve to pass, it needs at least 3 points at R2 = >0.99. 
2.	Correct sample concentration by subtracting average blank values.
3.	Measure the concentration of each sample. 
  -	If the value is above or below the lowest point of the calibration curve (i.e., above 1 ppm or 0.05 ppm), either dilute or denote that concentration is >0.05 ppm. 
  - Check the quality controls (duplicates and spikes, if applicable). Acceptable range is 15-20%, depending on your project. A passing plate requires that quality control accuracy is above 66%.
4.	Convert ppm to µg/g of soil (mg/kg) by multiplying by the volume (mL) of extractant used, followed by dividing the value by g of dry soil used. 

### When does a plate fail?
Plates fail when one or more of the following conditions occur:
1.	The calibration curve is below R2 = >0.99 with any combination of a minimum of 3 standards.
2.	The accuracy of all quality controls falls below 66%. 
3.	The blanks are erratic.
4.	The plate was dropped, or samples were splashed into neighbouring wells. 
5.	The plate incubated for too long before measurement. 

_If the plate does fail, it must be rerun (☹)._
 
## Cleaning up

Plates should be cleaned up immediately after measurement. Prolonged exposure of the plate to the colorimetric solution tends to dye the plastic, rendering it unusable in the future.
1.	Start by using a squeeze bottle to gently run water into each well. Guide the stream into the corresponding waste container. 
2.	Once all the noticeably coloured liquid has been removed from the plate, place the plate into the acid bath. Leave it overnight.
3.	If the plate appears stained, throw it out. If the plate appears clean, rinse with MilliQ in preparation for a future plate experiment.
