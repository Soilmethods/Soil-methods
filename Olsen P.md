# Olsen P

Soil sampls are extracted using a 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate solution (pH = 8.5) at room tmeperature. After filtration, the sample is acdified before quantification, either via FIA or plate method. The Olsen P method is best suited for calcareous soils, particularly those with > 2% calcium carbonate, but has been shown in some research to be reasonably effective for acidic soils. The method is based on decreasing the solution concentrations of soluble Ca by precipitation as CaCO3 and soluble Al3+ and Fe3+ by formation of Al and Fe oxyhydroxides, thus increasing P solubility.

## Chemicals and reagents

•	Distilled water

•	Sodium hydroxide, 1M. Dissolve 40g of sodium hydroxide, NaOH, in water and dilute to a final volume of 1000 ml.

•	Sodium hydrogen carbonate solution pH 8.5. Prepare solution using 42g of sodium hydrogen carbonate per l distilled water. Adjust pH to 8.5 with the 1M sodium hydroxide solution before bringing all the way to volume.

_The pH of this solution must be checked regularly, solution can only be used at the same day_

•	1.5 M sulphuric acid. Add carefully 80 ml of conc. sulphuric acid (3.8) to approximately 600 ml of distilled water. When the solution has reached room temperature, dilute to 1000 ml with distilled water.

## Equipment

•	magnetic stirrer

•	pH meter

• Two 50mL centrifuge per sample

•	Extraction vessels, such as 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, and filter funnels (9 and 11 cm) and racks 

•	Rotating or reciprocating shaker 

•	Quantitative ashless filter paper, 9 to 11 cm

## Procedure

1.	Transfer 2.5g dry weight soil into a centrifuge tube. Add 50 ml of the sodium hydrogen carbonate solution pH 8.5. Cap the bottle and shake on a rotary shaker for 30 min at 20 °C.

The reaction is strongly dependent on time and temperature, it is therefore essential that extraction time is observed!

2.	Immediately filter through the filter paper. In case of colored extracts, which can interfere at the measuring wavelength, add 1 to 2g of charcoal (tested for P) to the extract before filtration. Swirl to admit decolorisation and filter as above. The filtrate should be free from turbidity. 

3. _(optional)_ Note that CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles hinders photometric/spectrometric measurement. Before measurement on the FIA, add 1 ml of 1.5M sulphuric acid to 5 ml of sample. Use an ultrasonic bath for complete release of carbon dioxide or let stay for several hours under occasional swirling. Another option is to dilute the sample to minimize changes to pH when adding acidic quantification matrices.
