# Sequential fractionation of phosphorus pools 
### Source: Aimée Schryer's thesis, 2023
Sequential fractionation methodologies are a simple analysis that creates operationally defined pools based on theoretical solubility parameters (Negassa & Leinweber, 2009). 
These methodologies use buffers to alter the pH, redox potential, and ionic strength of the soil to release both P-minerals and Po species for subsequent quantification (Kruse et al., 2015). 
For example, the Hedley fractionation methodology broadly categorizes P into the following pools: chemically labile (sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)-extractable Pi and Po), moderately labile (sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-extracted Pi and Po), relatively stable 
(hydrochloric acid (HCl)-extractable Pi), and a stable, residual P fraction (Wang et al., 2022). Unfortunately, the information provided is limited. The extraction is not specific to any compound as P species remain or reprecipitate following the event (Wang et al., 2013).
Furthermore, validating that the pool targeted has been dissolved experimentally is laborious (Wang et al., 2013). Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Frossard et al. (1994) identified Ca-bound P minerals following HCl extraction. 
Additionally, minerals with a Ca: P ratio of >1 dissolved using less intense extraction matrices of water and NaHCO3 (Frossard et al., 1994). 
Ultimately, describing the structure and functionality of soil P fractions requires alternative methods. Rather, combining sequential fractionation with P speciation techniques provides a more robust opportunity to characterize soil P to overcome individual limitations. 

## Materials and methods: 
1.	50 mL centrifuge tubes with screw caps

2.	Filter paper.
  
3.	(Optional) Autoclave to estimate Po. See total P in aqueous samples methodology.
  
4.	(If using the resin method) 0.5 M HCl: dilute 44.25 mL conc. HCl to 1 L with MilliQ.
  
5.	(If using the resin method) Resin strips: use anion-exchange membrane cut into strips (9  62 mm) and convert to bicarbonate form. To regenerate after the adsorbed P has been extracted with HCl, wash resin strips for 3 days with 6 batches of 0.5 M HCl, followed by washing a further 3 days with 6 batches of 0:5 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 8.5). Then rinse well with MilliQ.
   
6.	0:5 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5): dissolve 42 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub> with 1 g NaOH in MilliQ and make to 1 L. (Note: the method says 0.5 g NaOH/L, but I find 1 g NaOH/L makes it really close to pH 8.5, meaning no alterations are necessary. Feel free to pH check at any point).  
   
7.	0.1 M NaOH: dissolve 4 g NaOH to deionized H<sub>2</sub>O in a volumetric flask and bring final volume to1 L.
   
8.	1 M HCl: add 88.5 mL conc. HCl to about 500 mL of MilliQ in a volumetric flask and bring to final volume of 1 L.

## Methodology: 
### Day 1:
1.	Weigh 0.5 g soil / 0.25 g amendment into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
   
a.	IF USING RESIN STRIPS: Add 2 resin strips and 30 mL MilliQ and shake overnight (16 hr).

b.	IF USING WATER: Add 30 mL of MilliQ and shake overnight (16 hr).

### Day 2:
1.	IF USING RESIN STRIPS: Remove resin strips and wash soil back into tube using deionized water. Place resin strip in a clean 50 mL tube, add 20 mL 0.5 M HCl. Set aside for 1 h to allow gas to escape, cap and shake overnight. Continue with step 3. 

_NOTE: Because the amount of water you need to clean off the resin strips will vary, I suggest weighing each tube and pairing with samples of similar mass to avoid an unbalanced centrifuge._

2.	IF USING WATER (i.e., skip step 1): Centrifuge soil at 5000 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant supernatant through a filter paper and wash/scrap any loose soil back into the centrifuge tube. 

3.	Measure phosphate in extract via FIA or plate method. If you want to estimate Po, see total P in aqueous samples methodology.

_Note: Quantification of phosphate is most accurate within 24 hours of sample collection, as Po can degrade overtime. Note that every step (apart from the 1M HCl sample) can possess significant Po, meaning that if you can measure phosphate day of or after, it will provide the most accurate results._ 

4.	At the end of the day, add 30 mL of the NaHCO3 solution and shake the suspension overnight (16 hr). 

### Day 3:

1.	Centrifuge soil at 5000 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant supernatant through a filter paper and wash/scrap any loose soil back into the centrifuge tube.

2.	Measure phosphate in extract via FIA or plate method. If you want to estimate Po, see total P in aqueous samples methodology.

3.	At the end of the day, add 30 mL of the NaOH solution and shake the suspension overnight (16 hr). 

### Day 4:

1.	Centrifuge soil at 5000 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant supernatant through a filter paper and wash/scrap any loose soil back into the centrifuge tube.

2.	Measure phosphate in extract via FIA or plate method. If you want to estimate Po, see total P in aqueous samples methodology.

3.	At the end of the day, add 30 mL of the 1 M HCl solution and shake the suspension overnight (16 hr). 

### Day 5:

1.	Centrifuge soil at 5000 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant supernatant through a filter paper and wash/scrap any loose soil back into the centrifuge tube.

2.	Measure phosphate in extract via FIA or plate method. NOTE: Weak acids are bad at extracting Po, so you can skip this extraction when estimating Pt.

3.	If you want to measure residual P (as in what’s left in the soil, because this methodology will not get it all!)¸ see the methodology by (Tiessen & Moir, 2007).
