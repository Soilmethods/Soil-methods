# Extraction for water-extractable P from soil 

Soil and water (ratio 1:60) is shaken for 1 hour and filtered before measuring the ortho-P concentration in the extract. 

## Chemicals and reagents

•	Milli-Q water

•	50 mL falcon tube

•	Whatman no. 5 filter

## Procedure
1. Weigh 0.75 g soil dry weight into a 50 mL falcon tube. KEEP RECORD OF THE MASS. 

2. Add 45 ml of milli-Q water to falcon tube using the automatic dispenser.

3. Shake samples for 1 hour on the end-over-end shaker

4. Centrifuge samples (4 min x 5000 rpm at room temperature) 

5. Filter the extract through a Whatman no. 5 filter (NOTE: ca. 7-10 ml is needed for the FIA). You can either filter the sample directly into the FIA tubes or into fresh falcon tubes and then transfer a subsample to the FIA tubes.

_Note: in some cases it can be useful to filter the extract through a 0.45 µm filter syringe filter, if a lot of organic matter exists_

6. Store the filtered extract for maximum 24 hours at 4˚C before FIA or plate analysis. 

7. Measure the phosphate content on the FIA using the low standard curve (0.005 – 1 mg/l).
