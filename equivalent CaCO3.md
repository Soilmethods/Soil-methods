# Equivalent Carbonates – rapid titration method

In this method, the soil is incubated with a weak HCl stock, which is neutralized by the carbonates in the soil (Rayment & Lyons, 2011). 
Using a glass burette allows for careful addition of 0.5 M NaOH to the sample to isolate the amount of reactive carbonates in the soil. 

## Materials: 
• 1 M Hydrochloric Acid: add 88.5 mL conc. HCl to about 500 mL of MilliQ and bring to final volume of 1 L.

• 0.5 M Sodium Hydroxide: dissolve 20 g NaOH in deionized H2O and bring final volume to 1 L.

• Phenolphthalein Indicator (0.1%): Dissolve 100 mg phenolphthalein (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) in 100 mL 100% ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH).

• Glass burette

• Wide-mouth plastic extracting bottles to hold soil and media.

## Methodology: 

1. Weigh 5.0 g air-dry soil (<2 mm) into a 250 mL wide-mouth plastic extracting bottle. Include two blanks (no soil) plus either a reference sample or 0.5 g CaCO3 powder. 

_Note: If carbonate content is known to be high in the soil: use 2.5 g of air-dry soil._

2. Add 100 mL 1 M HCl, cover in a manner that permits release of any CO<sub>2</sub>, and swirl occasionally for 1 h at 25°C. Allow to stand overnight, cap securely, then mechanically shake for 2 h. Let the suspension settle then filter or centrifuge. 

3. Take 10 mL supernatant into a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask and add 25 mL deionised water. Add 2–3 drops of the phenolphthalein indicator.

4. Titrate with 0.5 M NaOH until a colour change occurs. Record the amount of NaOH used.

5. Calculate % CaCO<sub>3</sub> equivalent using the following equation: 


% CaCO<sub>3</sub>  equivalent=  (M* (a-b)*50.04)/S

Where: 

a = mL of 0.5 M NaOH used for the blank,

b = mL of 0.5 M NaOH used for the sample,

S = weight (g) of the air-dried soil,

M = Molarity of NaOH used (in this case, 0.5 M),

50.04 = 50.04*10–3 × 10 × 100% (where 50.04 is the equivalent weight of CaCO3).
