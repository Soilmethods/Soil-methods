# Organic Phosphorus - Ignition method
Method lifted from (O’Halloran & Cade-Menun, 2008)

The method is suitable for determining soil P<sub>o</sub> in many samples. Note that no methodologies exist for directly measuring total soil P<sub>o</sub>. Instead, we measure an increase in phosphate concentrations caused by soil sample extraction or digestion. In addition, this procedure estimates P<sub>o</sub> (not quantifies it) due to issues such as incomplete P<sub>o</sub> oxidation and changes in P mineral solubility at high or low temperatures. 

## Materials and Reagents:

* Muffle furnace and porcelain crucibles.
* Polypropylene centrifuge tubes (50 mL).
* Filter paper.
* H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M: add 28 mL concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to a 1 L volumetric flask and makeup to 1 L.

## Methodology: 
1. Accurately weigh two samples: one 0.5 g soil into a porcelain crucible and a second 0.5 g soil sample directly into a centrifuge tube. Place the crucible in a cool muffle furnace.
2. Slowly raise the temperature of the muffle furnace to 550°C for 2 hours. Continue heating the samples at 550°C for 1 hour. Remove them from the muffle furnace and let them cool. (NOTE: P volatilizes at ~900°C, so a slight variation in temperature from the muffle furnaces is fine.)
3. Transfer the ignited soil to a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube.
4. Add 25 mL of 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to both samples. If the soils are calcareous, allow the sample to sit for an hour.
5. Tightly cap the tubes and place them on a shaker for 16 h. Include blank samples of 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
6. After 16 hours, centrifuge at 5000g for 5 minutes and filter using filter papers into a clean tube.
7. Determine the P concentration in an aliquot using the plate method (in the I-drive) or FIA.
8. Once the P concentration of each sample is isolated, calculate P<sub>o</sub> as the increase of phosphate after ignition of the soil sample via the following equation (NOTE: in mg kg soil<sup>-1</sup>, not ppm):

P<sub>o</sub>=P<sub>t</sub>  (ignited sample) - P<sub>i</sub>  (unignited sample)
