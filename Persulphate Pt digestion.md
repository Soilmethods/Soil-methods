# Persulphate Digestion: For Total P analysis after P fractionation

_**This protocol came from the book Methods for P analysis, J.L. Kovar and G.M. Pierzynksi (eds) under the title Total Phosphorus and Total Dissolved Phosphorus in Water Samples with the heading Persulfate Digestion Method B (Alternative).
This protocol has been revised from the book – some volumes have been adjusted **_

_Aimée’s note: You can probably skip Pt for the 1M HCl fraction, as there is rarely any Po because dilute acid is inefficient at extracting organic carbon from soils (Tiessen & Moir, 2007)._

## Reagents

### 3 M Sodium Hydroxide

•	Add 750 mL RO water to a 1 L volumetric flask

•	Add 120 g of NaOH and swirl to mix 

  <b>This will take some time to dissolve; swirl intermittently</b>

  _*NOTE: The solution will become quite warm, handle carefully*_

•	When NaOH beads are entirely dissolved, allow to cool to room temperature and bring to volume with RO water

•	Invert several times to mix, and transfer carefully to a clean, labelled bottle

### Potassium Persulphate Oxidizing solution

Makes enough for one complete set of fractionation samples (IE: less than 36 soil samples; 180 extracts)

•	Add 250 mL RO water to a 500 mL beaker with a magnetic stir bar; place on a heated magnetic stirrer on low heat and medium-slow stir speed

•	Add 32 g potassium persulphate; allow to stir until dissolved

•	Remove from heat and allow to cool to near room temperature. Transfer to 500 mL volumetric flask; triple-rinse the beaker into the flask with RO water

•	Add 40 mL 3 M sodium hydroxide solution

•	Bring the volume up to the 500 mL mark with RO water

•	As the solution cools, the persulphate will reprecipitate. Simply heat to dissolve back into solution. 

## Digestion Procedure

For each of the fraction extracts and fraction standards:

1.	Mix extract thoroughly, then pipette 25 mL into a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask. 

2.	Add 2.5 mL potassium persulphate oxidizing solution.
   
3.	Cap each flask with a square of aluminum foil (seal should not be air-tight)
   
    a.	Double layer the foil on the HCl extracts (some of the acid evaporates and dissolves through the first layer. This is normal)

5.	Autoclave for 55 minutes at 120°C. When complete, remove from autoclave and allow to cool
   
6.	Once cool, transfer digestate to a 50 mL falcon tube

    a.	Triple-rinse each flask into the tube with a small amount of RO water, then bring the volume in the tube up to the 50 mL mark

    b.	A precipitate may form. If this is the case, be sure to shake the digestate thoroughly before taking aliquots or pipetting for colour analysis

## Digestion Procedure (low volume) 

For each of the fraction extracts and fraction standards:

1. Mix extract thoroughly, then pipette 4 mL of sample into a culture tube.
   
2.	Add 2.5 mL potassium persulphate oxidizing solution.
   
3.	Tightly close the tubes with the caps.

4.	Autoclave for 55 minutes at 120°C. When complete, remove from autoclave and allow to cool.

5.	Measure using colormetric methodology. 

## Digestion Procedure (low volume) - Oven

1. Mix extract thoroughly, then pipette 4 mL of sample into a culture tube.
   
2.	Add 2.5 mL potassium persulphate oxidizing solution.
   
3.	Tightly close the tubes with the caps.

4.	Place the samples in a pre-heated oven @ 110°C for 60 minutes. 

5. Once cooled, samples are ready for further analysis.
