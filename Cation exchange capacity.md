# Cation exchange capacity

Last updated: 08/2023

## Chemicals and reagents:

•	1 M ammonium acetate pH 7: dissolve 77.1 g ammonium acetate in about 900 ml pure water. Note: ammonium acetate is very hygroscopic and should have been stored in a desiccator (soil lab)! After thoroughly mixing the solution, adjust the pH to 7.0 using acetic acid or ammonium hydroxide by inserting a pH electrode in the solution while stirring on a magnetic stirrer. Dilute to final volume of 1000 ml with pure water. (Can be stored for two weeks at 5 degrees)

•	Alternative method: 57 ml of glacial acetic acid (CH3 CO2H, CAS: 64-19-7) (99.5%) is added to ca. 500 ml MilliQ water. Then add 68 ml conc. ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, CAS: 1336-21-6) (25%). CAUTION: Use fume hood and add the ammonium hydroxide in the bottom of the acetic acid-solution with a long-neck funnel. Add sufficient pure water to obtain volume of 990 ml. After thoroughly mixing the solution, adjust the pH to 7.0 using ammonium hydroxide or acetic acid. Transfer to a volumetric flask and dilute to a final volume of 1000 ml with pure water.

•	1 M potassium chloride (KCl) (74.55 g KCl per 1 L milliQ water) (Can be stored for 2 weeks at room temperature or 1 month at 5 degrees)

•	Ethanol, 96%

•	Amounts of chemicals needed per sample:

      o	1 M Ammonium acetate: 	30 mL * 5 = 150 mL/sample
  
      o	Ethanol 96 %: 	20 mL * 4 = 80 mL/sample

      o	1M KCl:		20 mL * 6 = 120 mL/sample

## Equipment:

•	Analytical balance

•	50 ml Falcon tubes

•	Shaker

•	Vacuum pump + Erlenmeyer flasks (Procedure 1) <b>OR</b> Centrifuge (Procedure 2)

•	100 ml volumetric flasks

•	Filter paper (Whatman no 5)

## Which procedure to choose:

None of the procedures should be used to determine CEC in pure biochar materials. If you want to do so, see Munera-Echeverri, Jose L., Vegard Martinsen, Line Tau Strand, Valentina Zivanovic, Gerard Cornelissen, and Jan Mulder. "Cation exchange capacity of biochar: An urgent method modification." Science of the total environment 642 (2018): 190-197.

Procedure 1 using Erlenmeyer flasks: This procedure can be used for all soil types but is more time-consuming than procedure 2. It is fastest with sandy soils, as clayey soils will take longer to filtrate with the Erlenmeyer flasks. Anja has Erlenmeyer flasks and filters.

Procedure 2 using centrifuge: This method is best for loamy soils. Very clayey soils will get stuck in the bottom of the falcon tubes when they are centrifuged and it takes very long time to loosen the soil in the bottom. It is not good for sandy soils either as especially coarse sandy soils may be difficult to get to settle when using the centrifuge procedure.

### Procedure 1 using vacuum pump and erlenmeyer flasks:

_Note: You can do 18 samples per day with this method._

1.	Weigh 10 g air dried soil samples into 50 ml Falcon tubes.

2.	Add 30 mL ammonium acetate. 

3.	Shake the mixture for 2 minutes and put it into the fridge overnight (18 hours)

4.	Insert a porcelain funnel with a rubber stopper in the Erlenmeyer flask and put filter paper (Whatman no 5 size 90 mm in diameter) in the funnel. Attach the vacuum pump and shake the mixtures again for 2 minutes.

•	Start the pump and pour the sample onto the filter paper slowly. 

•	When all the liquid has been filtered, 30 mL ammonium acetate is added. Repeat this step four times in total. It is important that the soil does not dry out completely before the new liquid is added. Discard supernatant collected in Erlenmeyer flask.  

•	Add 20 mL ethanol. Repeat this step four times in total. It is important that the soil does not dry out completely before the new liquid is added. Discard supernatant collected in Erlenmeyer flask.  

•	Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask with MQ-water and discard the MQ-water. Do not rinse the porcelain funnel with the filter and soil.

•	Put the porcelain funnel back in the Erlenmeyer flask and add 20 mL 1 M KCl. Repeat this step four times in total. It is important that the soil does not dry out completely before the new liquid is added.

•	Filtrate the supernatant from the Erlenmeyer flask into a 100 mL volumetric flask using Whatman no 5 (size 125 mm in diameter). 

•	Fill volume up to 100 mL with 1 M KCl. 

•	Take a 20 mL subsample and keep it in the fridge or freezer prior to analysis for ammonium in KCL on the FIA.

### Procedure 2 using centrifuge (settings for sandy loam soil):

1.	Weigh 10 g air dried soil samples into 50 ml Falcon tubes.

2.	Add 30 mL ammonium acetate. 

3.	Shake the mixture for 2 minutes and put it into the fridge overnight (18 hours)

4.	Shake the mixtures again for 2 minutes and centrifuge at 5000xg for 5 min. Discard supernatant. 

5.	Add 30 mL ammonium acetate, shake for 2 minutes and centrifuge at 5000xg for 5 min. Discard supernatant.  Carry out this step four times in total.

6.	Add 20 mL ethanol, shake for 2 minutes and centrifuge at 5000xg for 5 min. Discard supernatant. Carry out this step four times in total.

7.	Add 20 mL 1 M KCl, shake for 2 minutes and centrifuge at 5000xg for 5 min. Filtrate the supernatant into a 100 mL volumetric flask using filter. Carry out this step four times in total.

8.	Fill volume up to 100 mL with KCl. 

9.	Take a 20 mL subsample and keep it in the fridge or freezer prior to analysis for ammonium in KCL on the FIA.

#### Calculation:
CEC(cmol kg-1) = CEC (meq (100 g)-1 = (mg NH4-N L-1) x (0.1L/10 g soil) x (1 meq NH4-N / 14 mg NH4-N) x 100 = (mg NH4-N L-1) x factor 0.071
