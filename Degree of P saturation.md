## Reagents
### Acid Oxalate Reagent
Dissolve separately 16.2 g ammonium oxalate [(COONH4)2*H2O] and 10.8 g oxalic acid [(COOH)2•2H2O] in deionized water, combine and make to 1.0 L. Check and adjust pH to 3.0±0.05 with either chemical. This reagent corresponds approximately to 0.114 M ammonium oxalate and 0.086 M oxalic acid, giving a total oxalate concentration of 0.2 M.

## Procedure
1.	Shake 1.0 g air-dry soil (<2 mm) with 100 mL Acid Oxalate Reagent in 250 mL bottles in the dark (wrap with aluminum foil) on an end-over-end shaker for 4 h at 25°C.
   
2. Following extraction, continue to avoid exposure to light for as long as the soil and Acid Oxalate Extractant remain in contact. Centrifuge to obtain ≈50 mL of extract, which should be clear when viewed using reflected light.

_NOTE: TAPE THE LID SHUT TO AVOID LEAKS_

3. Following separation of extract and soil, there is no short-term need to store extracts in the dark prior to instrumental analysis.

### Notes

• Calcareous soils should be pretreated to remove any CaCO<sub>3</sub>, since oxalic acid will react with solid-phase CaCO<sub>3</sub>, thus affecting the pH of the oxalate/oxalic acid buffer. The preferred pre-treatment involves use of ammonium acetate at pH 5.5 (Loeppert and Inskeep 1996). 

• Expect oxalate precipitation to form insoluble Cs salts, which may cause issues with ICP analysis. 

• Avoid high concentrations of oxalate during instrumental analysis (particularly by AAS) as oxalate can cause clogging of the burner head. To minimize this possibility, dilution (known volume) with deionized water to the extent possible is recommended by Loeppert and Inskeep (1996).
