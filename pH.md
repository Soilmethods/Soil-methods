# pH measurements
Principle: Potentiometric methods are based on the difference in potential between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell. 

## Chemicals and reagents 
_Note: Look at similar literature to your work to select the right media for your soil samples. The use of a 0.01 M CaCl2 solution will in general yield a lower pH value than will water. Water should primarily be used as an extractant for all materials other than soil._

•	Milli Q water. 

or

•	0.01 M Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution. 

Dissolve 1.11 g of calcium chloride  in Milli-Q water in a 1000 mL volumetric flask. Fill up to the mark with milli Q water. This solution may be stored for several months in a refrigerator in a closed volumetric flask or other type of closed glass vessel.

_Note: CaCl<sub>2</sub> has a MW: 110.99 g/mol. If you use a CaCl<sub>2</sub> with another molar mass (like CaCl<sub>2</sub>∙2H<sub>2</sub>O molecular weight: 147.01) please remember to re-calculate how many grams you need to make the right concentration stock._

## Equipment
•	pH-meter (soil lab)

•	Mechanical shaker

•	50 mL falcon tube

•	Lab spatula/spoon

•	Tube rack, styrofoam or plastic 

•	Dispenser

•	Scale (2 decimal places)

## Procedure for prepare the suspension
1.	Weigh 5 g (+/- 0.1 g) of air-dry  soil (<2 mm) into a 50 mL falcon tube.
2.	Add either 25 mL of milli-Q water or 0.01 M CaCl2 solution  
3.	Other materials such as sludge or biowaste are also suspended in milli-Q water at a 1:5 ratio. Other amounts can be used, as long as the ratio is maintained.
   
Ashes and biochars are suspended at a ratio of 1:25. 
For liquid manure and sludge samples, pH can be directly measured.

5. Shake samples for 1 hour using a mechanical shaker. After shaking wait for at least 1 hour, but not longer than 3 hours until measurement.  Ingress of air during standing after shaking should be avoided.
6.	Measure the pH in the suspension at 20˚C ± 2˚C immediately after having shaken the tube by hand.

_Note: Drying can influence the pH of the soil. Air-drying can be used for all soils, except for those containing sulphidic minerals or volatile acids. In both cases fresh soil should be used to avoid either sulphide oxidation resulting in the formation of sulphuric acid, or volatilisation of low-molecular organic acids. Regarding sludge and treated biowaste, fresh samples are recommended._
Impotent: The pH-meter MUST be calibrated before measuring the samples every time. Check the logbook, whether the pH-meter already has been calibrated the current day. If yes, you do not have to calibrate it. 
Instruction on how to calibrate the pH-meter can be found on the wall in the lab, by the instrument.
Note that buffers and samples should be read at room temperature, avoid temperature fluctuations and air flow around the pH meter.

## How to measure a sample
1. Turn the pH-meter on (switch at the backside on the left).
2. Take the electrode out of storage solution (3M KCl), remove any parafilm and the small blue “plug” from the top part of the glass electrode to open the small hole.
3. Control whether there is sufficient electrolyte in the electrode. If lower the 1 cm from the small hole, contact the lab. technician.
4. Rinse the electrode with milli Q water and dab it with paper towel.
5. Dip the electrode into your sample and measure. 
6. Wait until the pH is stable (appear as ‘STAB’ in the pH meter) and record the value.
7. Rinse the electrode in-between the samples with milli Q water, and dab it with paper towel.
8. When finished, rinse the electrode with milli Q water and dab with paper towel. Put the electrode back to the storage solution (3M KCl). It is important that the tip of the electrode is covered with 3M KCl. If not fill up. 
9. Put on parafilm and the blue “plug” back onto the hole.

_Note: For samples with a high content of organic matter or calcareous material, it may be difficult to reach an equilibrium value._

### Quality Assurance of the overall procedure:
A reference sample and one duplicate per 20 samples should be included.

Danish Standard for soil
The Danish standard method uses 0.01M CaCl2 as an extractant, in a soil: solution ratio of 1:2,5. The samples are thoroughly shaken by hand or stirred, left for 1 h, shaken again and measured immediately. The “reaktionstal (RT)” is calculated by adding 0,5 to the measured value.
