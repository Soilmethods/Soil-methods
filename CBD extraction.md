## Introduction

TBD. 

## Reagents
• 22% sodium citrate solution
Dissolve 220 g sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7.2H2O) in deionised water and dilute to 1.0 L. Prepare on the day required.

• Sodium Dithionite
Use sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4+H2O; tech) as a solid.

• Superfloc Solution
Dissolve 2.0 g Superfloc 127 or similar (supplied by Cyanamid Australia Pty Ltd) in deionised water and dilute to 1 L.

• Combined Fe and Al (and Si) Primary Standard
As for Method 13A1.

## Methodology

1. Shake 1.0 g air-dry soil with 50 mL 22% Sodium Citrate and 1.0 g Sodium Dithionite on an end-over-end shaker continuously for 16 h at 25°C. 

2. Accurately add 50 mL deionised water containing 5 drops of Superfloc solution, shake vigorously for 5 sec, and centrifuge or filter to obtain extracts free of fine soil particles.
   
3. Dilute these already diluted extracts 1+9 with deionised water and leave loosely stoppered in a cool place for at least 2 days. Include a reagent blank throughout.

4. Using undiluted working standards and clear soil extracts (diluted as above), read values of Fe and Al by ICPAES (preferred) or by AAS, and determine concentrations in mg/L of Fe
and Al from separate calibration curves (or regression equations). Significant background interference is likely with FES. Apply a method (blank) correction.
