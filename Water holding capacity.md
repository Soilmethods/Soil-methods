# Water holding capacity

## Equipment:
	
• Cylinder (glass, plastic, metal), approximately 20 mm to 50 mm in diameter and minimum 100 mm in length with a perforated base (or a fine gauze closing the bottom).

• Water bath, at room temperature.

•	Tray with a drainage hole, containing wet, fine quartz sand (10 cm), covered with moist filter paper

•	Drying oven, set to (105 ± 5) °C.

•	Analytical balance

•	Desiccator

## Procedure:

1. fill the cylinders with field-moist soil (3 replicates per sample) to 5-7-cm in small portions and provide homogeneous spreading by gentle tapping of the cylinder 

2. place the cylinders on a rack in the water bath at room temperature

3. Gradually submerge the cylinders until the water level is above the top of the soil, but below the upper lip of the tube. 

4. Leave the soil sample in the water bath for 24 h

5. Remove the cylinders from the water and place it on the tray with sand until constant weight is achieved (24h). Cover the cylinder to avoid evaporation!

6. Remove the soil from the cylinder to a beaker (with known weight)

7. Weigh the wet sample with the beaker, dry it to constant mass at 105 °C, cool in a desiccator and reweigh it.

## Calculation 

Calculate the water-holding capacity, as a percentage, using Equation (A.1):

<b> WHC (% of dry mass) =  (ms-md)/(md-mt)  ×100 </b>

WHC = the water-holding capacity, expressed as a percentage of dry mass, %;

ms = mass of beaker with wet sample (in g);

md = mass of beaker with dry sample (in g);

mt = mass of beaker (in g).

_Note: for determining WHC of biochar or ash, drying should be carried out at 40 ˚C._
